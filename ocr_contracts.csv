II. PRE-CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE CITY OF CARLISLE
(1)
The parties understand and intend that the City of Carlisle obligation to make the
payments hereunder shall not constitute a legal indebtedness of the City of
Carlisle within the meaning of any applicable constitutional or statutory debt
limitation. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are

the
foregoing intent of the parties.

months after the January 1 following the giving of the required notice.
(3)

effective date.
(4)
Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) or (3) above, in the event that any part of the

Agreement, the City may deliver to Bravo a notice to cure or remedy such default
or breach within sixty (60) days and if such default or breach is not remedied
within such cure period, this Agreement shall promptly terminate.
This Agreement shall terminate if Chapter 423A of the Code of Iowa is either: (a)
(5)
repealed or amended to remove the authority of the City of Carlisle to collect the
Hotel/Motel Tax at a rate of at least 7% or (b) so modified that the purpose of the
Agreement can no longer be carried out. If the Agreement terminates pursuant to
the previous sentence, the termination date shall be the June 30 coinciding with
or next following the effective date of the statutory change that causes the
termination.
This Agreement shall terminate if an alternative, reliable funding source is
(5)
secured for Bravo that provides funding to Bravo, in the reasonable determination
of the Bravo board of directors, that is comparable in amount to the annual
funding streams Bravo has secured in the aggregate through 28E agreements with
the cities, counties and municipalities of the Greater Des Moines Area (for
example, if Chapter 423A of the Code of Iowa were amended to increase the
Hotel/Motel tax and to direct a portion of the increase to Bravo in an amount
comparable to the annual funding streams expected from 28E agreements already
in place). If a reliable alternative funding source is secured for Bravo, which
partially replaces the funds provided by the City of Carlisle to Bravo, the amount
4
of annual funding provided to Bravo pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced
proportionately in such amount as the parties may reasonably determine. If the
Agreement terminates pursuant to this paragraph, the termination date shall be the
June 30 coinciding with or next following the effective date of the alternative
funding source that causes the termination.

for its board meetings and shall provide minutes of action taken via email to the
City Manager or its designee.
The City of Grimes and Bravo acknowledge that the communities within the
(2)
Greater Des Moines Area that make payment commitments to Bravo (Polk
County and the described communities are together the ""Participating
Communities"") and not-for-profit cultural organizations
within
such
Participating Communities may, as part of a cultural improvements capital
campaign, apply for grant funding. Bravo shall establish a separate fund to
provide matching funds to support the capital campaigns of not-for-profit

than 30 days after Bravo's Board of Directors approves Bravo's audited
fiscal year financial statements, a full accounting of Bravo's revenues,
disbursements and operations for such year in a form reasonably acceptable

VII. DURATION AND TERMINATION
(1)
This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date until terminated in
accordance with the terms of this Article VII.

Any such termination may be accomplished only by delivery of notice to the
other party not later than January 1 of any given year after the year ending
December 31, 2014 and shall be effective on July 1 occurring eighteen (18)
months after the January 1 following the giving of the required notice.
(3)
In the event that another Participating Community submits notice to Bravo to
terminate its payment commitment agreement with Bravo, Bravo shall provide a
4
copy of such notice to the City of Grimes. The City of Grimes may then deliver to
Bravo notice to terminate this Agreement with an effective date that coincides with
the termination date applicable to the terminating Participating Community. Such
notice to terminate shall become invalid if the terminating Participating
Community withdraws or otherwise revokes its termination notice prior to the
effective date.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) or (3) above, in the event that any part of the
(4)

Agreement can no longer be carried out. If the Agreement terminates pursuant to
the previous sentence, the termination date shall be the June 30 coinciding with
or next following the effective date of the statutory change that causes the
termination.
This Agreement shall terminate if an alternative, reliable funding source is
(5)
secured for Bravo that provides funding to Bravo, in the reasonable determination
of the Bravo board of directors, that is comparable in amount to the annual
funding streams Bravo has secured in the aggregate through 28E agreements with
the cities, counties and municipalities of the Greater Des Moines Area (for
example, if Chapter 423A of the Code of Iowa were amended to increase the
Hotel/Motel tax and to direct a portion of the increase to Bravo in an amount
comparable to the annual funding streams expected from 28E agreements already
in place). If a reliable alternative funding source is secured for Bravo, which
partially replaces the funds provided by the City of Grimes to Bravo, the amount
of annual funding provided to Bravo pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced
proportionately in such amount as the parties may reasonably determine. If the
Agreement terminates pursuant to this paragraph, the termination date shall be the
June 30 coinciding with or next following the effective date of the alternative
funding source that causes the termination.

(3)
30 days after Bravo's Board of Directors approves Bravo's audited fiscal year financial
statements, a full accounting of Bravo's revenues, disbursements and operations for such
year in a form reasonably acceptable to the City (""Financial Statements""). The Financial

Agreement can no longer be carried out. If the Agreement terminates pursuant to the
previous sentence, the termination date shall be the June 30 coinciding with or next
following the effective date of the statutory change that causes the termination.
(4)
This Agreement shall terminate if an alternative, reliable funding source is secured for
Bravo that provides funding to Bravo, in the reasonable determination of the Bravo board
of directors, that is comparable in amount to the annual funding streams Bravo has
secured in the aggregate through 28E agreements with the cities, counties and
municipalities of the Greater Des Moines Area (for example, if Chapter 423A of the Code
of Iowa were amended to increase the Hotel/Motel tax and to direct a portion of the
increase to Bravo in an amount comparable to the annual funding streams expected from
28E agreements already in place). If a reliable alternative funding source is secured for
Bravo, which partially replaces the funds provided by the City of Windsor Heights to
Bravo, the amount of annual funding provided to Bravo pursuant to this Agreement shall
be reduced proportionately in such amount as the parties may reasonably determine. If the
Agreement terminates pursuant to this paragraph, the termination date shall be the June
30 coinciding with or next following the effective date of the alternative funding source

AGREEMENT BETWEEN ADAMS TOWNSHIP AND THE PANTHER CREEK CEMETARY ASSOCIATION FOR THE
MAINTENANCE OF THE PANTHER CREEK CEMETERY
PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 28E OF THE IOWA CODE
This agreement is between the Adams Township, Dallas County, Iowa (Township) as duly represented by the Board of Trustees thereof,
and the Panther Creek Cemetery Association, Inc. (PCCA) respecting Township support for the maintenance of the Panther Creek
Cemetery located within Adams Township, Dallas County, Iowa, pursuant to Chapter 28E of the Code of Iowa.
Whereas PCCA, Inc is a private not-for-profit entity incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa, and therewith maintains the
Panther Creek Cemetery, a private cemetery in Adams Township, Dallas County, Iowa, and
Whereas Adams Township has the limited ability to levy for the maintenance of cemeteries within the township, including for the
maintenance of private cemeteries within the township at a limited amount allowed within the limits of the law per each fiscal year, and
Whereas Panther Creek Cemetery receives for burial, residents of the Adams Township without cost to said residents,
Therefore Adams Township and PCCA enter into this agreement for the Adams Township to provide mowing maintenance support for
Panther Creek Cemetery
Scope of the agreement. Township agrees to provide funds, up to the allowable legal limit, to assist PCCA in paying for a mowing
l.
contractor of PCCA's choosing, for mowing maintenance only, for Panther Creek Cemetery in Adams Township. In return, PCCA will
abide by its bylaws and be in compliance with all current state and local laws. PCCA will request funds from the Township each year by
obtaining and sending, via U.S. Mail, the mowing contractor's bid they have chosen to mow Panther Creek Cemetery for said given year,
to Adams Township Clerk prior to January 31st of each given year (2010's deadline March 15, 20/0); to thus allow Trustees to prepare
each fiscal year's budget. PCCA will then send, via U.S. Mail, mowing contractor's original monthly invoices, within the first five days
of each mowing season month (-April through November) for previous month's work for reimbursement. Each invoice must include
the following information:
•
Contractor's name, address, phone
•
Detailed monthly billing: name of cemetery mowed, dates work completed, detailed explanation of work completed,
i.e. mowed, trimmed, sprayed for weeds, etc.
•

shall terminate at the end of the fiscal year in which notice is timely given (June 30).
The Adams Township Board of Trustees is administrator of this agreement. No separate organization is contemplated.
3.
4.
Financial. Adams Township agrees to provide limited funds for the cost of mowing operations for Panther Creek Cemetery.
Therewith, Adams Township will levy a tax within the provisions of Iowa Code for Township maintenance of private cemeteries within
the township, and annually budget such levied ansount for the maintenance of Panther Creek Cemetery and such other private cemeteries
within the township as deemed appropriate by the Adams Township Board of Trustees. PCCA understands there is a limit to the amount
that is allowable by law to be levied for privately owned cemeteries, that this amount cannot be amended or changed if already at the
maximum amount per fiscal year and that such funds are also available to other privately owned cemeteries that may at present, or in the
future, request financial assistance from Adams Township. PCCA will be responsible for all other costs of maintenance of the Panther
Creek Cemetery. This agreement does not provide PCCA the ability to control the funds levied by the township. Such funds shall be
budgeted by the township trustees, and may therewith be specially allocated as contemplated herein, with the Township Trustees
providing specified maintenance services. It is at the sole discretion of the Adams Township Board of Trustees to decide how funds may
be allocated to private cemetery association(s) such as PCCA, i.e. in block grants or monthly reimbursements, whichever is deemed
most beneficial and cost effective. Adams Township reserves the right to refuse to provide funding for failure of private cemeteries to
provide timely and detailed information as requested above.
5.
This agreement is effective on filing and recording upon approval of the statutory officers of the affected departments and as
authorized by the governing bodies of the respective entities, and upon recording with the Dallas County Recorder.
